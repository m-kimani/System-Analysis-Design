# DriverPass - System Analysis & Design

	The client for this project was DriverPass, a driver education company who wanted a new system to provide a way for drivers to schedule in-person driving lessons online. I did particularly well creating sequence diagrams to describe the data flow for different use cases like logging in and creating a reservation. If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, it would be my UML class diagrams. I would revise the diagrams to also show the methods that would be available for each class. I interpreted the userâ€™s needs and implemented them into my system design by using the requirements discovered during system analysis and walking through the use cases with the user to determine any other needs or edge cases the user would need to perform the action. 

	My approach to designing software begins by first gathering the system requirements through the system analysis phase. During this phase, I gather information on the proposed system by interviewing clients and users and looking over any existing documentation. I then use the gathered information and system requirements to create different diagrams that work together to describe the system. Techniques that I would use in the future to analyze and design a system would be conducting group interviews with different types of system users. This would allow me to quickly gather the most important system requirements that are relevant to most or all users.
